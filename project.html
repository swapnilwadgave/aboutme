            <p><em>I have been a professional programmer in one sense or another since I graduated from Savitribai Phule Pune University in 2020.  I learned the valuable lesson that the best teachers aren't necessarily found at the most prestigious Universities.  I think most folks should do likewise. Without the "real world" providing perspective it's way too easy to get caught up in theories about how to write good software that aren't really very practical.

                Most of my work has in one way or another related to making things easier for people who use computers - both for the end users and for programmers .  Over the course of my career software development has moved from deep within the realm of experts to approaching the realm of just about everyone... My passion is to encourage that trend in every way that I can.</em></p>
